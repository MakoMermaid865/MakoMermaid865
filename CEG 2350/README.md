## In this course, I am working with both Linux and Windows operating systems to build a solid foundation in system administration. I am gaining hands-on experience with:  

- Managing files, directories, permissions, and user accounts  
- Using the command line for automation with scripting and regular expressions
- Understanding and controlling system processes, programs, and libraries
- Exploring secure network protocols and administration practices  

This course is helping me strengthen my skills in working directly with operating systems and giving me practical tools for managing and securing computer environments.
